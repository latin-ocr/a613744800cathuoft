discipline, especially with regard to the intercourse per-minui
either in boys' or in girls’ schools‚ between pupils os ‹liffvn-nt
religione: such as whether they may frcely ass-‹wiate and κροκι(
with one another, or are fordiddcn to speak upon religion<
topice. It would also be necessary to know how the non-
Gatholics are directed in religious matters: nanu-ly, whetlwr
they are educated in the Catholic religion, with, or with-
·out, the consent of their parent83 and, if the-y an». not so
educated, whether they are permitted, or even obliged, to h·-
present, together with the CatholicS, at Holy Mass and other
practices of piety3 whether they have always to ahstain froin
receiving their own sacramentS, or are allowed sometimes to
receive them in their schismatical churches, and, if so, who
goes with them. Again, it would be important to know th«-
number of Protestants and schismatics in each institution,

It would be necessary, therefore, that the superiors of th«-
*eeveral Missions should obtain, if possible, the informationi
-above referred tc, respecting the mixed boarding-sehools (or
colleges) under their J urisdiction, and should send it to the S.
Congregation, so as to be furnished in reply with instructions
suitable to the, peculiar circumstances of each case. ln tlw
meantime, however, it will be useful to make known a decisioni
which the Holy Office has recently given in the case of a mixed
boarding-school‚ of Catholic girls of the Latin Rite and schis-
matics of the Oriental Rite. But it will be well, before
quoting it, to give some idea of the internal regulations of thc·
school, in order that the decision may be better understood.

The establishment is under the direction of nunS, for the
education of Catholic girIS, together with schismatics of tho
Oriental Rite. The proportion between them has not always
been the same. For the last five years the schismatics haw-
formed about a third part of the school. They are instructed,
not only in secular subjectS‚ but also in the Catholic religion if
their parents expressly desire it. Besides receiving Catholic
instruction, the schismatical pupils have spiritual reading,
'make spiritual retreatS, and are present daily at holy Mass,
