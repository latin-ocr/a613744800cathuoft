how great is the influence of the authority of teachers over the
young minds of their pupiIS, and how strongly the pupils are ”
thereby drawn to approve whatever their teachers say or doz “

whence it happens that, while receiving instruction in the above-

named schools, they adopt almost unconsciously the errors of f·
their 100011018, and learn to despise the Catholic religion. Add 1
to this the daily and familiar intercourse with young Protestants ..
and schismatics, who by their habits, which often are corrupt, by 1
their indocility‚ and by their satirical remarks upon our holy .ῃ

1110 books are Catholic, there is nothing to fear in this respect.
The S. Congregation of Propaganda haS, therefore, in times past

tolerated, and even given leave for, the admission of the chil-
dren of heretics into schools established in the Missions under 2

the direction of the missionarieS, and has allowed them to be
instructed therein by the Catholic teacherS. Ν evertheleSS, the
said Congregation was aware that even in such schools as these,
Catholic as they are in their management and teaching, a great
danger would still 01180 from the admission of schismatical and
Protestant pupils, chiefly by reason of their daily contact with
the children of Catholics3 and therefore, when allowing such
admission, it was careful to prescribe certain precautions for
