APPEND. xv. 329

·vation of souls was threatened by the new system3 and by
suitable admonitiom, sermons, and pastoral letters, to preserve
the saith from the contagion of error.

6. In regard to the mixed University Schools and Colleges,
established by the English Governmcnt on the same system for
the scientific instruction of youth, this Sacred Congregation, in
a letter of October 9, 1847, expressed to the Irish Bishops its
fear that such Colleges would be dangerous to the Catholic saith
and injurious to religion: and it admonished them to have
nothing to do with such establishments 3 and exhorted them
rather to improve the condition of the existing Catholic Col-
leges, and to endeavour to erect a Catholic Academy. To allay
the fears which had arisen, the English Government made some
modifications in the statutes of the aforesaid system3 but this
Sacred Congregation, on a subsequent examination of the ques-
tion, and considering the great intrinsic dangers of the system,
did not deem it right to change its resolution, as above given3

and this was communicated to the Irish Bishops in a letter
-dated October 11, 1848.

7. Lastly, it will be well to add the reply which, after
examining the ruleS‚ the Sacred Congregation, at its general
meeting of August 31, 1863, made to the founder of the Insti-
tute of the Sisters of Notre Dame de Sion, established in
France. Speaking of the girls educated in their schoOIS, it said
·“ that it was the desire of the Sacred Congregation that, as a
general rule, only Catholic girls should be received. That if
it happened that, for some grave reason, girls of other religions
were admitted, to be brouyht up, however, as Catholies, the
Bishop of the diocese should be informed of it, so that he might,
'in concert with the Superiorem, make such arrangements as
should be necessary for removing all danger of perversion ; and
that one rule should be that, when the girls were visited by
their relativeS, a sister should always be present.”

I have thought it well to bring these points under your
'Lordship’s notice, that you may be safely guided in a matter
