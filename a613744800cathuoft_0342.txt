30. Passing over other similar (1001810118, we may refer to J
the 0380 of the Armenian Bishops of the ecclesiastical province - 3,
—of Constantinople, wh0‚ at a conference held in 1853, had ’
011111110131οᾶ among the means of converting the schismatics of ἶ
111011 11311011 1110 allowing their children to attend¹ Catholic J
80110018. Τ110 General congregation of Propaganda thereupon “
gave orders for a letter to 110 written to the Archbishop and ξ,
Ρ11111310, saying that' the proposed means was recognised as well ῖ
adapted to effect the conversion of the schismatics; but that

great prudence was necessary to prevent any evil consequenceS.

For, in the first place, the Catholic children might be 111 danger
of perversion, if they were allowed to hold long conversations ᾗ
with the schismatical pupils; inasmuch as there would be found J

among the schismatics shrewd and 1310111οᾶ youthS, wh0‚ by
their training at home, had become deeply rooted in schism3

and among the Cat-holics there would be some of poor 3111111108, “

and of little religious feeling. Secondly, if the schismatic‘s
were obliged to attend the religious exercises of the CatholicS,

there would 110 danger of 111011 becoming hypocrites by pre- ’ζ’
tending 10 110 0311101108, 311(1 of their thus becoming indifferent f

10 311 religion. The Archbishop was then reminded that 111010

was no question of admitting them to the sacraments, as that '

1111181 110 preceded by a formal abjuration, and a sincere declara-
tion of their return 10 1110 Catholic religion. Finally, in order
to ward off the dangers above mentioned, in schools where

- Catholics and schismatics are mixed together, the Bishops of ’s

the province were advised to draw up in their next provincial
001111011 8111131110 regulations for these mixed 80110018, subject 10
1110 approbation of this Sacred Congregation.

3. We have lastly to speak of the admission of schismatics
and Ρ10108131118 11110 Catholic boarding-schools and colleges.
It would be impossible to lay down a sure and adequate rule,
applicable to every such house of education, without special
and accurate knowledge of all the circumstances affecting them.
Hence it would be necessary to know precisely the object of the

² institution, the 800131 position and age of its pupils, the kind

and extent of the education there given, and its 111108 of 1111011131
